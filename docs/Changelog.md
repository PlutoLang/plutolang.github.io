This page contains the changelogs from all [releases of Pluto](https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto/releases).

## 0.10.1
- Compatibility: Fixed not inferring that a keyword should be disabled from parameter
- Universal Block Opener: Fixed `do` not being accepted instead of `then` for `catch` and `$if`
- FFI library: Improved cdef parsing and error reporting
- Crypto library: Fixed returning incorrect hex digest for MD5 in some cases
- Socket library: Fixed an issue where the remote closing a connection too soon could cause recv/peek to never see some data that was sent

## 0.10.0
- Added chained comparisons (e.g. `1 <= i <= #t`)
- Added private methods to classes
- Private fields (and methods) can be declared and accessed anywhere inside the class now. Previously, you needed to define a private field *before* you accessed it. This is no longer a restriction.
- Pluto now automatically detects if non-compatible keywords should be enabled or disabled based on usage
  - This is overwritten by the scripter using `pluto_use` or the integrator or user managing compatibility mode, so it only applies when absolutely zero configuration has been applied. This is a significant improvement for lua source code compatibility. 
- `do` can now be used instead of `then` and `begin`
- `if` expressions are now no longer deprecated but require an `end` (e.g. `print(if a then b else c end)`)
- `$define` statement now requires an assignment
- Fixed not being able to load Lua C modules on Linux
  - For simplicity in this regard, Pluto now always uses the C ABI to export `lua_` functions and the C++ ABI for `pluto_` functions.

Standard library:
- Added canvas library
- Added ffi library
- Added regex library
- Added assert.contains

- Added optional limit argument to string.split
- Added io.cwd and io.chdir as aliases for io.currentdir
- socket.starttls can now be used on server sockets
- Optimized json.encode with `__order`

- Fixed table.clear not resetting cached length
- Fixed http.request allowing header values to contain CR and LF (CVE-2024-45597)

## 0.9.3
- Added a warning for '(' being used instead of '|' for pipe operator arguments
- Improved error reporting when an invalid parent is given to 'extends'
- Fixed extending a global class unexpectedly pushing _G
- Fixed incorrect results when using 'not' on result of null coalescing operator
  - As a result of this fix, the null coalescing operator is now bytecode-compatible with Lua
- Fixed parsing ambiguities with ternary expressions in switch cases

Standard library:
- Fixed `json.encode(json.decode(..., json.withnull + json.withorder))` producing unexpected artifacts
- Fixed data corruption when json.decode is used on large data
- Fixed insufficient TLS peer verification in HTTP library and socket.starttls in non-WASM builds (CVE-2024-32973)

## 0.9.2
This release fixes several regressions made in 0.9.1:
- Fixed failing to compile on aarch64
- Fixed method calls no longer working in ternary expressions even with parentheses
- Fixed walrus operator no longer being usable within unary operator expressions

Furthermore, it improves the walrus operator in regards to disallowing UB and clarifying related error messages.

## 0.9.1
- Improved try/catch
- Improved parsing of for-as loops

For a more comprehensive overview of the changes, [take a look at the commit log](https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto/compare/0.8.0...0.8.1).
## 0.8.0
- Added switch expressions
- Added shorthand fallthrough syntax for switch statement & expression, e.g. `case 1, 2: ...`
- Added try...catch statement
- Added spaceship operator (`<=>`)
- Added safe navigation for method calls: `nilable_inst?:method()`, `inst:nilable_method?()`, `nilable_inst?:nilable_method?()`
- Added optional 'const' keyword as shorthand for `local ... <const> [= ...]`, enabled with `pluto_use const`.
- Added `pluto_use "VERSION+"`
- Tables now have a metatable by default (`{ __index = _G.table }`).
- Added '!' as an alias for 'not'
- Added 'private' modifier for class fields
- Improved 'class' and 'extends' to support indexed names
- Improved 'instanceof' to be usable with more complex expressions
- `export` now works in all scopes, not just the main body
- Updated `in` operator on tables to check values instead of keys
- `\{` is now a valid escape sequence (for interpolated strings)
- Fixed to-be-closed variables not working in switch cases
- Fixed 'new' not working as expected if it was disabled by the environment and re-enabled by 'pluto_use'

Warnings:
- Added warning for local attributes used without '&lt;' ... '&gt;'
- Now propagating types for global variables so when their value is assigned to something, mismatches can be detected.
- Added optional `global-shadow` warning which is like `var-shadow` but for globals that are especially vulnerable to obscure shadowing bugs (to prevent excessive annoyance).
  - These globals include: `arg`,`string`, and `table`. Integrators can change this via `PLUTO_COMMON_GLOBAL_NAMES`
  - Global shadow warnings do not apply to localization optimization (i.e, `local table = table`)
- `var-shadow` has been improved to check more enclosing scopes
- Improved `unreachable-code`
- Fixed var-shadow warning for locals used in switch cases despite break
- Added optional `non-portable-code`, `non-portable-bytecode`, and `non-portable-name` warning types

Standard library:
- Soup is now always linked in, obsoleting `_PSOUP`

- Added string.truncate
- Added string.replace — a slightly faster, but mostly more straightforward alternative to gsub.

- Enabled Lua's jump table for clang build as well
- Fixed a VM performance regression introduced by Pluto
## 0.6.1
- Improved suggestions (for when using plutoc with the language server)
- Optimized switch statement code generation (now omits cases leading to default case)
- Fixed producing syntax error when 'case' or 'default' is used outside of switch
- Fixed using 'export' outside of global scope not producing an error

## 0.6.0
- Added `<constexpr>` attribute to force locals to be compile-time constants
- Added `$expr` syntax for compile-time evaluation of select functions
- Added `export [NAME=VALUE | function | class]` syntax
- Added named arguments (`name=value` in funcargs)

- Removed `when` statement

Enums:

For integrators upgrading to Pluto 0.6.0:
- Consider defining `PLUTO_COMPATIBLE_NEW`, `PLUTO_COMPATIBLE_CLASS`, `PLUTO_COMPATIBLE_PARENT` & `PLUTO_COMPATIBLE_EXPORT` so 'new', 'class', 'parent' & 'export' will not be reserved keywords just yet, instead 'pluto_new', 'pluto_class', 'pluto_parent' & 'pluto_export' can be used.
