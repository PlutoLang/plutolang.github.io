Lambda expressions are an alternative way of writing anonymous functions.
```pluto showLineNumbers title="Old Way"
local s1 = "123"
local s2 = s1:gsub(".", function(c) return tonumber(c) + 1 end)
print(s2) -- "234"
```
```pluto title="New Way"
local s1 = "123"
local s2 = s1:gsub(".", |c| -> tonumber(c) + 1)
print(s2) -- "234"
```
#### [Try It Yourself](https://pluto-lang.org/web/#code=local%20str%20%3D%20%22123%22%0D%0Alocal%20inc_str%20%3D%20str%3Agsub(%22.%22%2C%20%7Cc%7C%20-%3E%20tonumber(c)%20%2B%201)%0D%0Aprint(inc_str)%20--%20%22234%22)

As you can see, they take an expression after the arrow, the result of which is implicitly returned.

However, lambda expressions can also have full bodies using `do`...`end`:

```pluto
local add = |a, b| -> do
    print($"Adding {a} and {b} together")
    return a + b
end
```

They also support all other syntax you would expect of functions, such as type hints and default arguments.
