# What is Pluto?
Pluto is a superset of Lua 5.4 designed for general-purpose programming. While being remarkably compatible with Lua 5.4 source-code & bytecode, it enhances the standard library & adds more than a dozen highly-desired syntaxes such as switch statements, compound operators, classes, class inheritance, string interpolation, type hinting, enums, and so on.

Pluto retains the easy embeddability of Lua, while offering a much improved developer experience.
