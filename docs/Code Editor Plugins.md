Although Pluto can theoretically be used with Lua-based tooling, there is specialised support for it to enhance your coding experience in VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.

## Syntax Highlighting

There is a TextMate bundle for Pluto [available here](https://github.com/PlutoLang/Syntax-Highlighting). It provides syntax highlighting as well as snippets (e.g. when you type "fun" then press tab). This can be used in many applications, including Sublime Text and VS Code.

## Language Server

[pluto-language-server](https://github.com/PlutoLang/pluto-language-server) is a simple wrapper on top of plutoc's ability to give you warnings, errors, and suggestions/completions, using LSP to deliver it right into your text editor.
