Prevention","title":"Infinite Loop Prevention","description":"Pluto can detect infinite loops by preventing too many successive iterations. This was implemented because game threads usually force users to call some sort of yield mechanism to return control to the game thread. In Pluto, you specify a hard bottleneck on iterations, then you specify a function pointer which should prevent ILP within the loop it\'s called in.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"For Integrators/VM Dump":{"id":"For Integrators/VM Dump","title":"VM Dump","description":"Pluto offers an optional, configurable feature to see every instruction that is executed in the Lua VM.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Getting Started":{"id":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","description":"This document will explain how to get started with writing Pluto in no time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction":{"id":"Introduction","title":"What is Pluto?","description":"Pluto is a fork of the Lua 5.4 programming language. Lua is designed to be a small, fast, and embeddable language. It\'s used very often in games and resource-restricted regions. Lua bites a bullet by needing to stay small though, it lacks general-purpose features. This strain on the language makes it difficult to produce complex scripts at an accelerated rate. It takes more time to implement alternatives for missing syntax, or writing your own manual functions to split strings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/Break Statement":{"id":"New Features/Break Statement","title":"Break Statement","description":"This keyword accepts an optional integral argument which tells it how many levels of enclosing loops it should break.
