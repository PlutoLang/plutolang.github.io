are allowed to run in your environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"For Developers/Execution Time Limit":{"id":"For Developers/Execution Time Limit","title":"Execution Time Limit","description":"To aid environments that have to be sandboxed, Pluto provides Execution Time Limit (ETL), which can be enabled by defining PLUTOETLENABLE in luaconf.h or your build config.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"For Developers/Infinite Loop Prevention":{"id":"For Developers/Infinite Loop Prevention","title":"Infinite Loop Prevention","description":"Pluto can detect infinite loops by preventing too many successive iterations. This was implemented because game threads usually force users to call some sort of yield mechanism to return control to the game thread. In Pluto, you specify a hard bottleneck on iterations, then you specify a function pointer which should prevent ILP within the loop it\'s called in.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"For Developers/VM Dump":{"id":"For Developers/VM Dump","title":"VM Dump","description":"Pluto offers an optional, configurable feature to see every instruction that is executed in the Lua VM.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Getting Started":{"id":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","description":"This document will explain how to get started with writing Pluto in no time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction":{"id":"Introduction","title":"What is Pluto?","description":"Pluto is a fork of the Lua 5.4 programming language. Lua is designed to be a small, fast, and embeddable language. It\'s used very often in games and resource-restricted regions. Lua bites a bullet by needing to stay small though, it lacks general-purpose features. This strain on the language makes it difficult to produce complex scripts at an accelerated rate. It takes more time to implement alternatives for missing syntax, or writing your own manual functions to split strings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/Break Statement":{"id":"New Features/Break Statement","title":"Break Statement","description":"This keyword accepts an optional integral argument which tells it how many levels of enclosing loops it should break. The default value is 1, thus breaking out of the current loop.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/Compiler Warnings":{"id":"New Features/Compiler Warnings","title":"Compiler Warnings","description":"Pluto offers optional compiler warnings for certain misbehaviors.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/Default Arguments":{"id":"New Features/Default Arguments","title":"Default Arguments","description":"During a function declaration, parameters can now declare their own default value.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/In Expressions":{"id":"New Features/In Expressions","title":"In Expressions","description":"Searching a string for a substring, or searching an array for an element is a very simple operation now.

Pluto now offers this syntax:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/String Indexing":{"id":"New Features/String Indexing","title":"String Indexing","description":"You can index strings for their characters now, which is cleaner & 3x faster than using string.sub. String indexing only occurs when you index with an integer, either positive or negative. Positive integers index from the start of the string, and negative integers index from the end.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/String Interpolation":{"id":"New Features/String Interpolation","title":"String Interpolation","description":"String interpolation is very simple.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Features/Table Freezing":{"id":"New Features/Table Freezing","title":"Table Freezing","description":"Tables can now be frozen at their current state to forbid any future modification.

They skip the current iteration of the loop, and they\'ll skip any code necessary to do so.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"New Syntax/Lambda Expressions":{"id":"New Syntax/Lambda Expressions","title":"Lambda Expressions","description":"Lambda expressions are shorthand function objects for evaluating quick expressions.

On a consistent basis, pairs & ipairs loops are 3.5x faster than their Lua counterparts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Optimizations/Jump Table":{"id":"Optimizations/Jump Table","title":"Jump Table","description":"Lua implemented a jump table, but it is not portable. Pluto has an additional jump table implementation for other compilers; however, it is not enabled by default as it can add minutes to compile time, depending on the setup. In some instances, it can increase overall virtual machine performance by ~5%.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Optimizations/Long Jump":{"id":"Optimizations/Long Jump","title":"Long Jump","description":"Although Lua presents the option to use long jumps even when compiling as C++, it doesn\'t default to doing so, instead requiring you to define LUAUSELONGJMP.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Optimizations/Special Arthimetic":{"id":"Optimizations/Special Arthimetic","title":"Special Arthimetic","description":"Special arithmetic algorithms are optimized by Pluto during compile-time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Optimizations/Table Length":{"id":"Optimizations/Table Length","title":"Table Length","description":"Pluto will cache the length of a table when you request it for the first time. This cache is refreshed whenever you make an edit to the table. It\'s still advisable to localize this value though, since looking through the cache and the virtual machine is expensive compared to looking up a local.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"QoL Improvements/Better Method Creation":{"id":"QoL Improvements/Better Method Creation","title":"Better Method Creation","description":"A series of methods was otherwise ugly to implement into a Lua table.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"QoL Improvements/Improved Iteration":{"id":"QoL Improvements/Improved Iteration","title":"Improved Iteration","description":"Pluto improves iteration in a few ways.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"QoL Improvements/Optional Parentheses":{"id":"QoL Improvements/Optional Parentheses","title":"Optional Parentheses","description":"The parenthesis around some types of expressions are optional now.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"QoL Improvements/Reserved Identifiers":{"id":"QoL Improvements/Reserved Identifiers","title":"Reserved Identifiers","description":"Pluto allows you to use reserved tokens such as if from Lua and when from Pluto as identifiers with shorthand table syntax and for goto labels.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"QoL Improvements/Syntax Errors":{"id":"QoL Improvements/Syntax Errors","title":"Syntax Errors","description":"The messages for syntax errors are enhanced.
